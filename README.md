## To setup


- You will need to set a openweathermap.org api key in the .env file with the key OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY
- Note, it usally takes an hour for the api key to be activated
- If you want to receive emails, you will need to set up a mail host in the .env file.
- Front end looks like a dogs dinner, sorry bout that.
